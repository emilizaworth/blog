  It seems like things are moving along pretty smoothly. The instructors are readily available to answer questions, so that's comforting. <br/>

        It's crazy to think about how much more I already know after sitting in on two classes. I can't wait to see where I'm at after 10 weeks!

		I'm a newbie (sorry Elyse, I know you said not to say that). I definitely need to learn the vocabulary quickly, but I feel okay right now with my progress. It's definitely easier to sit in a class full of instructors/co-workers who can give you pointers. Perhaps I'll ask Ravi about getting a delicious treat for the part-time students soon! :)
